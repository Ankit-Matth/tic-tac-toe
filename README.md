# Tic Tac Toe

While exploring the official documentation of React.js, I got an idea to create a Tic Tac Toe game, as all the details needed for the game were provided in the documentation itself. Consequently, I decided to implement my React.js knowledge in developing this game. Through hands-on implementation, I gained a solid understanding of leveraging React's capabilities for efficient component rendering and dynamic state updates. This project not only strengthened my proficiency in React but also enhanced my ability to design and manage interactive user interfaces with ease.

## Technologies Used

1. React.js
2. Html, CSS, Javascript
3. JavaScript Syntax Extension

Creating the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)  felt like going on a coding adventure where every line of code taught me something new. Throughout this process, I focused primarily on React.js, deepening my understanding of concepts like Hooks and state management in React. Additionally, I added some animations and sound effects to make this game look cooler and more attractive. Overall, this project wasn't just coding; it was a hands-on learning journey that significantly contributed to my growth as a web developer.

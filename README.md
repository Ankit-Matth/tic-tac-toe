# Tic Tac Toe

While exploring the official documentation of React.js, I got an idea to create a Tic Tac Toe game, as all the details needed for the game were provided in the documentation itself. Consequently, I decided to implement my React.js knowledge in developing this game. Through hands-on implementation, I gained a solid understanding of leveraging React's capabilities for efficient component rendering and dynamic state updates. This project not only strengthened my proficiency in React but also enhanced my ability to design and manage interactive user interfaces with ease. Additionally, I integrated end-to-end testing into this project using Cypress, ensuring its functionality through rigorous testing. This experience has provided me with insights into ensuring comprehensive test coverage and reliable functionality across the entire application.

## Technologies Used

1. React.js
2. Html, CSS, Javascript
3. JavaScript Syntax Extension
4. Cypress for End-to-End Testing 

Creating the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) and integrating end-to-end testing into this project using Cypress felt like going on a coding adventure where every line of code taught me something new. Throughout this process, I focused primarily on React.js, deepening my understanding of concepts like Hooks and state management in React. Additionally, I added some animations and sound effects to make this game look cooler and more attractive. Overall, this project wasn't just coding; it was a hands-on learning journey that significantly contributed to my growth as a web developer.

## Getting Started 

**Note:** *Make sure Node.js (npm) is installed before proceeding.*

Follow the steps below to install and run the project on your local machine.

**1. Clone this repository:**
  ```bash

  cd tic-tac-toe
  ```
**3. Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
**4. Start development server:**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
**5. Visit `http://localhost:3000/tic-tac-toe` to see the magic.**

### Below are the commands to execute the end-to-end tests:

**1. Install Cypress:**
  ```bash
  npm install cypress --save-dev
  ```
Note: There is no need for the above command if you run `npm install` during the setup of the project.

**2. Open Cypress:**
